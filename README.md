# unit6Game - GIPHY Generator

What the project does
This Project demonstrates how to use the GIPHY API to bring back images based on preset Sea Creature Buttons. User can add additonal Sea Creatures (or anything other value that will return a GIF). ONce those additonal Buttons are added, the user can then click on the new Button to load those GIFs. GIFs always load from left to right, top to bottom, with most popular GIFs showing first.

Why the project is useful
THe project is useful as it helps educate the coder on what can be achieved by utilizing APIs. It also incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It's also improving my current Bootstrap Portfolio by including a link to the GIPHY Generator game.

How users can get started with the project
You can review the various coding documents, most importantly the logic.js file within the assets/js folder. Less important but still beneficial would be to review the index.html main file, along with the style.css file in the assets/css folder.

Where users can get help with your project
You can get help with this project through Bootstrap, jQuery, and the GIPHY Developer docs, all found through any internet search engine.
